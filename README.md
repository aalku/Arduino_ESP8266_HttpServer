# Arduino_ESP8266_HttpServer
Arduino + ESP8266 HttpServer

It uses AT commands.

This is in early development.

It has two pages.
- / it's a hello world
- /wifi lists the wifi networks. In the future it will let you connect to one of them.

It has issues under certain conditions but mostly works.

I want you can connect to it's softAP, use it to configure the wifi network and then access it through it and forget the softAP.
